# Install Liminal in Airflow

## Workflow
To deploy and run liminal on airflow, we need to complete two tasks:
1. Ensure that the Liminal python package is installed inside each one of Airflow's pods (schedulers and Web Server)
2. Ensure that the user's Liminal code (i.e. Yamls) are present in each of the pods' DAGs folder (typically located in /opt/airflow/dags)

The first task is accomplished by iterating over Airflows' k8s pods and running a pip install on each of them.

The second task is accomplished by using a folder on a shared filesystem (EFS) to host the airflow DAGs (and Liminal Yamls). \
This folder is mounted into Airflow pods' DAGs folder - thus enables each of the pods to pick the files up and run the Liminal DAGs.

The process of liminal is emphasized on the following diagram:

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements: 
* You have the kubectl command line [(kubectl CLI)][homebrew-kubectl] installed
* You have the current [context][cluster-access-kubeconfig] in kubernetes' kubeconfig file
* You have [Airflow on Kubernetes with AWS EFS][airflowInstallation]

### Supported Distributions

|Distribution | Versions |
|-|-|
|[Airflow][airflowImage] | apache/airflow:1.10.14-python3.8 |
|[Airflow Helm Chart][airflowChart] | [7.16.0][airflow-helm-chart-7.16.0] |

#### You may need to add the Repo

```sh
helm repo add airflow-stable https://airflow-helm.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

## Get Started
#### Package dependency
There are multiple ways to install liminal in Airflow and it depends on what will be useful in your environment.\
We chose to add `apache-liminal` as a requirement package to be installed once Airflow starts.

#### Mount the EFS
There are a couple of ways to deploy Yamls in Airflow our goal is to deploy the actual Yamls (DAGs) into airflow - by placing the Yaml files in each components\` `/opt/airflow/dags` folder.

There are multiple ways to achieve this.

Our recommended approach is to use EFS as a shared folder containing the Liminal Yamls. \
To this end, you will need to perform the deployment from a (separate) linux box, which can get hold of the Liminal Yamls and deploy them into the EFS - which we shall name "the deployment box".

One time setup:

1. Use the EFS file system that you created for Airflow DAGs folder
2. Mount the EFS file system onto a deployment box:
```sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <EFS_ID>:/ /mnt/efs```
3. Create a folder on an EFS drive. This will be our target for deployment
```mkdir -p /mnt/efs/opt/airflow/liminal_home```
4. ```export LIMINAL_HOME=/mnt/efs/opt/airflow/liminal_home```
5. Follow the guide <<<>>> for deploying Airflow on K8S, with EFS mount.
Point the pods' PV to the right EFS folder, like so:
    ```
    volumeMounts:
        - name: efs-data
          mountPath: /opt/airflow/dags
    ```
    where efs-data is a PVC pointing to `<EFS_ID>:/opt/airflow/liminal_home`

Once this setup is done (one time), you have:
1. A deployment box which can deploy Liminal to an EFS folder
2. Airflow pods which will pick up the Yamls from that folder automatically.

#### Liminal deployment
Each time you want to deploy the Liminal Yamls from the deployment box:
```
liminal deploy --path <<<path to liminal user code>>>
```

#### Scripted Installation
[Use `install_liminal_in_airflow_on_kubernetes.sh`][liminal-installation-script] to install liminal in Airflow.
